# Chess-game
A terminal-based chess game which includes a completely functioning 1v1 chess game.
This game was created, using Java, as a side project during my OOP course in order to
understand the language better.
# Functionality
All chess rules including special moves such as castling and en passant.
You can resume a game by inputing a FEN string.
# Starting a match
Simply run the Main.java main method and begin a new chess game!
# What's next
Looking for any bugs and ways to simplify/optimize code.
